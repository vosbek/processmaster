# Chrome Extension Icons

Place the following icon files in this directory:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon for the extension toolbar
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixel icon for extension management  
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon for extension management
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon for Chrome Web Store

## Icon Requirements

- Use PNG format with transparency
- Icons should be square (same width and height)
- Use a consistent design that represents ProcessMaster Pro
- Recommended: Blue/purple gradient with a camera or document icon
- Ensure icons are clearly visible on both light and dark backgrounds

## Temporary Placeholder

For development, you can use any PNG files with the correct names and dimensions. The extension will work with placeholder icons during development.
